# HT16K33 4 character display base component

This component provides the common functionality for both the 4 character 14 segment alphanumeric display and the 4 character (plus colon) 7 segment character display. It cannot be used as standalone. Use the ``ht16k33_alpha`` or ``ht16k33_7segment`` components instead.
